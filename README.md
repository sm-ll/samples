A place for samples

- Barbarella samples are created by me based on some uses found in various Rising High Records releases.
- GS_Londonsen_TR909_Kit is sourced from http://synthslut.blogspot.com/ and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLnvtX2Sng4 and placed here to ensure more widely available.
- LonDonsen_Moore_TR808_Kit is sourced from http://synthslut.blogspot.com/ and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLnvtX2Sng4 and placed here to ensure more widely available. These are suite to Round Robin methods.
- Vital_blips made using Vital softsynth. Use as desired.
- Drum2_breaks created using a synth and DAW for some processing. Set at 155 BPM if you want to timestrech etc.
